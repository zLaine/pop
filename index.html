<h2>Medic</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Players perform triage as a conscientious objector during the war.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players will have to decide whether they have time to treat all a patient's wounds or pass them by -- you only have so much time to spend per person when doing triage.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
A time-based medical sim game.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player uses the mouse to drag banadages to the wounds on the soldier to patch them up.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Experimentation with making a time driven game that is fun instead of frustrating/stressful.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The concept is somewhat unique, but the more interesting gameplay mechanics haven't been added in yet, as this is more of a test on working with time sensitive games -- an aspect of gameplay I generally dislike as a player.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
It's about a soldier drafted for the Vietnam war who dislikes war and killing -- so he opts to become a medic instead.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who have an intest in emergenct medical situations (as the later mechanics do actually reflect real-life priorities when in a triage situation) and making life or death choices. 
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
About a minute, can get longer as you get better at the game.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Effective strategies in the current version bandaging those with 3 or less injuries -- more and you should pass.
</li>
